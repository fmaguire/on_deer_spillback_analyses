# Sequencing
## Combined ARTIC and Bait Genomes

CFIA-generated sequences combining ARTICv4 and FusionGenomics Bait Capture Data.

Sequencing was processed by Peter Kruczkiewicz using viralrecon v2.3 with a modified reference gff with ORF1a and ORF1b separated (and additional steps disabled)

From these results (summarised in xlavir report: `sequencing_reports/CFIA_illumina_combined_artic_v4_and_fusion_genomics_bait_xlavir_report.xlsx`) 5 complete (>95%: 96.7% to 99.8%) and 2 partial genomes (>75% complete: 4538:86.5%, 4534:94.6%) were derived.

To these the human sample has been added from PHO.

These can be found in `final_on_deer_and_human_whole_and_partial_genomes.fna`
