# Comprehensive selection analysis of ON WTD Clade

Subsampled B.1, animal, and genomes with fewer than than 0.1% Ns but more than 0% Ns to avoid any "fill in N's with the reference sequence genomes in the database".
Virulign was used to generate codon alignments and then RELAX, aBRESEL, and BUSTED were executed via hyphy.
All executed commands can be found in `selection_analyses.sh`
