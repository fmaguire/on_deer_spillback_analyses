# comparison\_of\_passaged\_genomes\_to\_originals

To ensure that isolated viruses did not acquire significant mutations during
passaging they were sequenced and analysed using an identical viral-recon 
run (`passaged_genomes_viral_recon/run_genome_analysis.sh`).

Then the `passaging_variant_dynamics.ipynb` workbook was used to generate the 
mutational heatmap analyses to compare original to passaged samples.
