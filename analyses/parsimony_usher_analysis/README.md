# Parsimony Usher Analyses

Done via the usher [webportal](https://genome.ucsc.edu/cgi-bin/hgPhyloPlace) using the full set of sequences (`../../sequencing/final_on_deer_and_human_whole_and_partial_genomes.fna`) on 2022-03-05.
This uses the 8,153,100 genomes from GISAID, GenBank, COG-UK and CNCB (2022-03-02) placed with usher onto the sarscov2phylo 13-11-20 tree.

This analysis was performed to A) identify closely related sequences for inclusion in other analyses (e.g., recombination) and B) as a parsimony-based validity check for the maximum-likelihood phylogenies
