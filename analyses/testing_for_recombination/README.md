# testing\_for\_recombination/

Recombination analyses using 3seq (with conservative and restrictive p-value
thresholds `3seq/run.sh`)

`GARD/` has the outputs from a hyphy analysis using GARD.

`bolotie/` contains input data for bolotie but the raw output and intermediate files
are too large to include.

Finally, `sarscov2recombinants/` was a quick analysis using the tool by [lenaschimmel](https://github.com/lenaschimmel).
